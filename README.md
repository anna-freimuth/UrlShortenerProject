# UrlShortenerProject

Url Shortener Service allows generating a short URL link 
instead a long URL link. When a client opens a shortened
URL link, he will be redirected to the original URL.

Statistical analysis, including how often a URL link
has been opened, will be performed in the background.

This project is done in accordance 
and under guidance of the Tel-Ran school. A template
project for this project can be found here:
